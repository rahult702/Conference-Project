          <h4 class="profession">DESIGNING A CULTURE OF DESIGN</h4>
          <p class="theory">
            Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a
            beer fridge, and it doesn’t end with neckties, PCs, or big
            corporations. It’s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and the
            motivations that enable good work to get done, or it’s what stifles
            a workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to
            feel valued, we need to work in a culture that embraces design and
            allows it to succeed.
          </p>
          <p class="theory2">
            In Aaron's session he will explore how to recognize the traits of
            organizations that *get* design, both large and small. He will share
            what those teams, departments, and companies have that others don’t,
            and more importantly, how to begin to change your own workplace’s
            culture. Once you’ve worked within a culture of design it’s almost
            impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.

            LIGHTS! CAMERA! INTERACTION! DESIGN INSPIRATION FROM FILMMAKERS
          </h4>
          <p class="theory">
            Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with
            a combination of well-written narrative and effective storytelling
            technique. It’s the filmmaker’s job to put this together. To do so
            they’ve developed processes, tools and techniques that allow them to
            focus attention, emphasize information, foreshadow and produce the
            many elements that together comprise a well-told story.
          </p>

          <p class="theory2">
            With this workshop, we’ll revisit the topic of using stories in
            design and expand on the technical aspects used in film to
            communicate. We’ll look at some tools used in film, such as
            cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We’ll consider why
            they’re used and how we might look to them for inspiration.

            JavaScript applications frequently utilize battle-tested libraries

            DEATH TO WIREFRAMES: LONG LIVE RAPID PROTOTYPING
          </h4>
          <p class="theory">
            Static wireframes are a drag on the whole design process.
            Prototyping makes things a little better by allowing you to stitch
            together static wireframes or mockups while adding basic
            interactions. Rapid prototyping with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is
            even better and faster; it increases collaboration and improves the
            iteration process. Kill your wireframes. Long live rapid
            prototyping.
